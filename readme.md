1. Install the user script on some user script engine (TamperMonkey, etc.) by [clicking here](https://github.com/isra00/buccaneer/raw/main/Buccaneer.user.js).
2. Install DownThemAll or other download manager.
3. When reading online a book **you have borrowed**, click "Buccaneer this!".
4. Wait for all images to finish loading.
5. Use DownThemAll or similar to bulk-download the book pages that are shown in the page.

 - You may increase DownThemAll's "simultaneous downloads" to speed up the process.
 - This will work too if you like saving the images from ChromeCacheView
 - Be cool to the guys at The Internet Archive, they're just under much pressure from the publishing lobby!
