1. Install the user script on some user script engine (TamperMonkey, etc.) by [clicking here](https://github.com/isra00/buccaneer/raw/main/Buccaneer.user.js).
2. Install DownThemAll or other download manager.
3. Borrow the book you want to download (if it's not open access), and, from the online reader page, click "Buccaneer this!".
4. Use DownThemAll or similar to bulk-download the book pages that are shown in the page.

 - During the download, keep the book page open on another browser tab, and flip pages randomnly from time to time to simulate real reading activity.
 - You may increase DownThemAll's "simultaneous downloads" to speed up the process.
 - If you prefer saving the images from ChromeCacheView, this method works too. Just wait for all the images to load (scroll down the page to see if new pages are beaing loaded).
 - Be cool to the guys at The Internet Archive, they're just under much pressure from the publishing lobby!
